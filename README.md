First, I created a backend file and made a sample JSON file. I created a schema for that file and added a GET request to retrieve data. To do this, I used packages such as mongoose for the schema, Express for the RESTful API, CORS to handle cross-origin errors, and body-parser to parse JSON data. I also used dotenv to hide sensitive details.

Then, I created a frontend using React and installed necessary packages, including react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop features. I made a fetch request to retrieve data from the backend and created two components: "Education" to display education details and "WorkExperience" to show work experience information. I included both components in the App.js file and displayed the data in the user interface.
